# ESP32-EVB
ESP32 WiFi / BLE development board with Ethernet, relays, microSD card, CAN, infrared, Li-Po charger, GPIOs made with KiCAD

Hardware revisions:

- revision A - internal, not released
- revision B - initial public release
- revision C - changes:

1. MicroUSB connector moved back, 40 mils to the middle of the board.
2. All mounting holes are now connected to GND.
3. Improved the ground layer around the infra red's pads and wires.

- revision C1 - changes:

1. Changed R38 from 10k/0603 to 100k/0603 to lower the time without clock
2. Changed C28 from 100n/0603 to 10n/0603 to increase the time in reset

- revision D - changes:

1. Added a resistor (1k) between OSC_DIS and reset of the PHY.
2. Added option to use MCP2562-E/SN and SN65HVD230D upotreba -> R58(NA/R0603)!
4. U2 be promeneno ot SY8009AAAC(SOT23-5) na SY8089AAAC(SOT23-5).
5. FET1 and FET2 were changed from IRLML6402 to WPM2015-3/TR.

- revision D1 - changes:

1. Removed C18(10uF)
2. U8 changed from BD5230G-TR(SSOP5/SOT-23-5) to NCP303LSN27T1G(SOT-23-5), due to unavailability;
3. C28 changed from 100nF/50V/20%/Y5V/C0603 to 470nF/16V/10%/X7R/C0603, because of the U8 change;

- revision D2 - changes:

1. U6 changed from MCP2551-I/SN(SOIC-8_150mil) to MCP2562-E/SN(SOIC-8_150mil)
2. R58 changed from NA/R0603 to 0R/R0603.

- revision E - changes:

MCP2551 got "Not recommended for new designs" status so it is replaced with MCP2562 and this lead to:

1. R58(0R/R0603) was deleted and U6's pin<5> was connected to +3.3V.
2. R52(680R/R0603) was deleted.
3. R50(330R/R0603) and R51(330R/R0603) were deleted.
4. The MCP2562-E_SN(SOIC-8_150mil)'s symbol was updated, i,.e. U6's component was exchanged with 2562!

Changes related to the problems with ethernet PHY:

5. The following components were added to enable powering on the PHY after the 50MHz oscillator has been started: L5(NA(FB0805/600R/2A)), FET3(WPM2015-3/TR), FET4(BSS138), C29(22uF/6.3V/20%/X5R/C0603), R50(1k/R0603) and R51(10k/R0603).

Changes related to optimizations:

6. R26(330R/R0603) and R27(330R/R0603) were changed to 220R/R0603 to reserve a feeder.
7. C1 was changed from 47uF/6.3V/20%/X5R/C0805 to NA(47uF/6.3V/20%/X5R/C0805).	
8. C3 was changed from 47uF/6.3V/20%/X5R/C0805 to NA(47uF/6.3V/20%/X5R/C0805).

- revision F - changes:

1. BUT1 and RST1 new packages.
2. Minor PCB routing optimizations.
3. All footprints were updated.

- revision G - internal, not released

1. Changed the Li-Po charger to BL4054B (was MCP73833 previously).

- revision H

1. CH340 now powered only from USB (not from battery). Added D7 and D8 on TX/RX, levels are adjusted via R35 and R40. Pin #20 now disconnected. SY8089AAAC(SOT23-5) devider now R20 49.9k and R19 220k. R24 now 470ê.
2. Added battery voltage sense option. This is controlled with jumper BAT/BUT1, C30, R9, and R10. It is not enabled by default to maintain compatiblity with previous revisions.
3. Added 3D models of the components.
4. L2 now 2.2uH/1.5A/DCR=72mR/20%/3.00x3.00x1.50mm/CD32(NR3015T2R2M). Some improvements on ESP-WROOM-32_MODULE package.
